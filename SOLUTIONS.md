There are many different ways to solve each level. These are not the "best" or the "optimal" solutions, but they are "a" solution to the levels. If you're stuck and can't seem to complete the level or want to see a different approach, you are more than welcome to check them out. But for your own enjoyment, we suggest that you try to complete the levels on your own first.
