# Descent
  Descent is a puzzle game where the player moves through a number of maze-like chambers in order to reach the door leading to the next level beneath. 
  
  The goal of Descent is not only to succesfully escape from the chamber but doing so with as few moves as possible. 
  
  The player has the ability to move in 4 different direction during which the player moves as far as possible in that direction until an obstacle prevents them from continuing further.

  In the event of not encountering an obstacle in the row/column while moving, the player appears at the other side of the same row/column, continuing its movement until an obstacle is met.

  In some levels, the player can not go through the door unless the key is acquiered beforehand. Before the player acquieres the key, the door acts as another obstacle.
  
  The player is awarded at the end of each level with stars according to its move count. If the move count is equal to or less than the predetermined number, the player earns 3 stars. If it's less then two times of that number, the award is 2 stars. The player is awarded at least 1 star for each completed level.
  
  The player may replay the levels by pressing "r" during any level. But after the level is completed it is not possible to replay the previous levels without starting from the first level. That is, the player has to be certain before completing the level that it is the best possible solution they could come up with, in order to have the highest score possible.
  
  Currently the game has 10 levels. But in time the number will increase so as the number of different game mechanics and features.
